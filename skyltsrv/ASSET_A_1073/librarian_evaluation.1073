                         ASSET_A_1073 Evaluation.
                        =========================
Asset Title: Socket++

Evaluation level:   LEVEL 3  -  Compiled

   ASSET has tested software files for compilation and document files for 
   printability.  No deficiencies or internal inconsistencies were found.

Evaluator:  Roy Hollinger               Evaluation Date:  11-DEC-1995

Evaluation Summary:

This software suite was compiled with g++ vers. 2.7.2 with g++ lib
2.7.1 on an RS6000 AIX. The compilation produced minor warnings that did
not effect the performance or linkage of the executables.

Deficiencies:
Minor discrepancies in README file: Version number wrong, should be 1.10.
Directions for making testing programs should be 'make CXX=g++ check'.

The main Makefile has no target for 'check' as described in the README file.


Vendor Rebuttal:
Vendor made no rebuttal to evaluation.

   Reusability       X            socket++ was developed as a C++ interface
                                  library for the Unix socket library.
